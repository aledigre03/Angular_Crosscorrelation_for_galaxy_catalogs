# Cross Correlation methods to study the interloper fraction on Euclid catalogs
The files in this repository were created to test and perform angular correlation between galaxy catalogs. The main use is to find interlopers in catalogs produced by the Euclid mission.
-numberdensity.py computes the number density of galaxy catalogs in a range of redshifts in units of N/(Mpc^3/h^3)
